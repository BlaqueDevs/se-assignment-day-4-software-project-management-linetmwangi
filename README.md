. Ensures Stakeholder Confidence – Investors and stakeholders are more likely to support a project with controlled costs.

Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns
. Accurate Budget Estimation- Use historical data from similar projects to create a realistic budget.Include all costs (development, testing, deployment, maintenance).
. Agile Development Approach- Build in iterations, delivering small, functional parts of the project.Allows cost adjustments and prevents large-scale failures.
. Scope Management (Avoid Scope Creep)- Clearly define project requirements and stick to them.Use a Change Control Process to evaluate and approve new feature requests.
. Regular Cost Monitoring & Forecasting- Track expenses with budgeting tools like Jira, Trello, or Excel.Compare actual spending vs. budgeted costs at every milestone.
. Prioritization & MVP Approach- Focus on essential features first before adding extra functionalities.Helps manage costs and ensures core product delivery.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
. Agile is an iterative and flexible approach where the project is divided into small, manageable increments called sprints. It allows continuous feedback and adaptation while Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. There is little room for changes once a phase is finished.
. Agile is highly adaptable, allowing changes even in later stages of development. It thrives in dynamic environments where requirements evolve frequently while Waterfall is rigid and best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements that are unlikely to change. Once a phase is completed, revisiting it is costly and time-consuming.
. In Agile, the product is developed in increments, and functional parts are delivered frequently (e.g., every 2–4 weeks). This ensures continuous progress and quick feedback from stakeholders while In Waterfall, the product is delivered as a whole at the end of the development cycle, meaning stakeholders must wait longer before seeing results.
. Agile reduces risk by allowing early testing and course correction. If issues arise, they can be addressed in the next sprint without major disruptions while Waterfall has a higher risk because errors or requirement changes discovered late in development can be expensive and difficult to fix.

Main Advantages & Disadvantages
Agile Advantages
. Faster delivery of functional features
. More flexibility to accommodate changes
. Higher stakeholder satisfaction due to continuous feedback
. Lower risk of project failure through iterative improvements

Agile Disadvantages
. Difficult to predict budget and timeline due to constant changes
. Requires high team collaboration and discipline to manage sprints effectively
. Not ideal for projects with strict regulatory or compliance needs

Waterfall Advantages
. Clear structure with defined milestones and documentation
. Easier budgeting and cost estimation
. Works well for projects with fixed requirements and no expected changes

Waterfall Disadvantages
. High risk of failure if requirements are misunderstood in the beginning
. No early product testing, so issues may be discovered too late
. Less flexibility, making it unsuitable for projects with evolving needs

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial
Agile is ideal for dynamic, fast-changing projects where requirements evolve over time, and continuous feedback is needed. 

Examples of Projects That Benefit from Agile
. Software Development Startups – A fintech company building a new mobile banking app may start with a minimum viable product (MVP) and add features based on user feedback.
